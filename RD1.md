We were meant to create a program to translate encrypted files into English. It was meant to give us practice with 
dictionaries, following problem-solving techniques, creating functions, and doing file I/O. The translation function 
was a big issue. I've asked my partner to check what we have and why it isn't working out because I wrote most of the 
code. Working with my partner was difficult because it is incredibly difficult to do decent work over Thanksgiving 
break, but I managed to do most of the coding, entrusting the final error checking and algorithm writing to my partner.
